Report
=============================================================
The report includes a summary of my research, experimentation,
and development using vision transformers (ViT).
Transformer-based vision models (i.e. sequential, generalizable, overparameterized models adapted for computer vision using the attention mechanism) are still very nascent.
The original contribution of this project lies in exploring a novel approach for quantifying image quality from neural image compression and generation using a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture.
The newly developed evaluation metric, called a ViT-Score,
