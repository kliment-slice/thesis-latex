\section{Takeaways}

It will take 100M dollars and a lot of work from a giant tech company, but
future is near. The next major image compression methodology will be deep learning-based.
The next image quality assessment will be deep learning-based.
Transformers are ideal fit, highly generalizable, highly performant, hard to train.
