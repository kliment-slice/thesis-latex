\section{Key Contributions}

(experimentation with Vision Transformers, nascent field)
Main merit of this thesis:
ViT-score, a ViT-Assisted metric for evaluating the performance of a neural image compression
Generative Adversarial Network.


\section{Takeaways}

A Vision Transformer (ViT)-Assisted metric related to image compression can provide 
additional insights to the latent space (contextual) preservation.
Thus, this work can be viewed as a stepping stone towards an end-to-end Transformer-based
image compression and regeneration.

It will take 100M dollars and a lot of work from a giant tech company, but
future is near. The next major image compression methodology will be deep learning-based.
The next image quality assessment will be deep learning-based.
Transformers are ideal fit, highly generalizable, highly performant, hard to train.


\section{Acknowledgments}

The author would like to express gratitude towards several individuals and organizations
from The University of Texas at Austin campus.


The major inspiration for this project was gathered from two courses taught by the
reviewers of this thesis.


EE 371Q, Digital Image Processing taught by Professor Alan C. Bovik was the class
where the author learned about 
Image Compression, Image Quality Assessment, and completed a term
project on Generative Adversarial Networks.


CSE 382, Foundations of Machine Learning taught by Professor Rachel A. Ward 
was the class where the author learned key concepts used throughout this thesis
and completed a term project on Vision Transformers (ViT).


Further acknowledgments are made to the Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering (LIVE) at the 
University of Texas at Austin for providing a source for project inspiration and insights.


Finally, the author would like to express gratitude to The Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).
TACC provided free access to advanced High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources,
which were used throughout the experimentation process in this thesis.
