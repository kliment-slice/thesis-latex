% ABSTRACT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

\begin{abstract}
    This work investigates a novel application of a Vision Transformer (ViT) as a 
    quality assessment reference metric for generated images after neural image compression. 
    The Vision Transformer is a revolutionary implementation of the Transformer attention 
    mechanism (typically used in language models) to object detection in digital images. 
    The ViT architecture is designed to output a classification probability distribution against
    a set of training labels. 
    Thus, it is a suitable candidate for a new method for quantitative assessment of generated 
    images based on object-level deviations from the original pre-compression image.
    The metric will be referred to as a ViT-Score.
    This approach complements other comparative measurement techniques based on per-pixel 
    discrepancies (Mean Squared Error, MSE) or structural comparison (Structural Similarity Index, SSIM). 
    This study proposes an original end-to-end deep learning framework for neural image compression, 
    latent vector representation, regeneration, and image quality analysis using 
    state-of-the-art model architectures. Neural image compression and generation 
    is achieved using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). 
    Results from this work demonstrate that a ViT-Score from a Vision Transformer is capable of assessing 
    the quality of a neurally compressed image. 
    Moreover, this methodology provides valuable insights when measuring image quality.
    It can be used in addition to established perceived quality metrics for compressed and generated 
    images such as SSIM and Frechet Inception Distance (FID).

\chapter{Introduction to Vision Transformers (ViT)}


% Chapter overview 
This chapter presents the reader with an introduction to Vision Transformers (ViT).

It covers the motivation as to why ViT, or a future development inspired by it,
will have a profound impact on image compression, analysis, and generation overall.
This chapter presents evidence that a Transformer, or perhaps an evolved deep learning model with a
similar architecture, i.e. generalizable and highly overparameterized, can be superior in
compressing and evaluating the latent feature space of a digital image compared to present-day
technologies.

This section then reviews a brief history or Transformer usage in deep learning.
These generalized architectures are dominating state-of-the-art language models,
as they are extremely efficient in packing information within a one dimensional vector.

This introduction will then proceed to describe the principles of operation of a ViT. Then, proceed with
a mathematical formulation. Finally, it will cover currently available implementations
in the form of pre-trained models and conclude with an explanation on the computational and
financial constraints of training such demanding architectures.

\chapter{ViT-based Assessment of Neural Image Compression}

Now that we explained relevant transformer components, we can see how it applies to 
2D signals, i.e. image matrices for classification purposes in image recognition.
The Vision Transformer or ViT, was very recently published for ICLR 2021 by a google 
team for a ImageNet trained transformer.
Tokenization happens at pixel level, so each pixel would have to attend to each other 
pixel in the grid, which becomes too heavy to compute, on the order of. 
To resolve that, the image is broken down into blocks of equal size, a 16x16 subset 
of the image called image patches. Then, unroll each image patch into a sequence (256x1), 
and index it with a positional embedding in a table. All of that is then fed into a 
standard Transformer, like from Attention is all you need. Finally, a feed forward 
classifier (MLP) makes the classification prediction, voila image recognition.
The total number of parameters is on the order of 100M.
